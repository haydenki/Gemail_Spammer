# Gemail_Spammer
A little program for playing a harmless prank on your friends.

Written on 12/13/18
Written in Python 3.7.3 with the 'smtplib' library.

NOTE FOR GMAIL USERS:
If you're using gmail with this app you have to go through an extra step.
Goto https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps (your gmail settings) to enable sign in
from less secure apps before you start the program. Everything will work fine after.
